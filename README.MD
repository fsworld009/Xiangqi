## Xiangqi (Chinese Chess)
![Xiangqi](images/screenshot.png?raw=true)

This game is a chinese chess game written in MFC.

This project was a team project in my MFC programming course in college.

You can download the game in Releases page.

### Trouble shooting
- In Windows 10, you need to set compatibility to Windows 8 in order to see the board
- If the game log is garbled, please change the system locale to `Traditional Chinese (Taiwan)`, or use [NTLEA](https://ntlea.codeplex.com) or [Locale Emulator](http://pooi.moe/Locale-Emulator/) to run the program in Traditional Chinese.
